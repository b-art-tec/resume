<span style="color:lightgray">Manchester, United Kingdom</span>\
*Research Associate* (post-doc)
- Introduction of novel approaches to the development of parametric (semi-empirical tight-binding) and machine learning (ML) atomistic models, in particular, integrating classical concepts of optimal design with modern data-driven (atomistic) methods to improve the accuracy and transferability/robustness of ML models.
- Innovative generative surrogate models designed to be seamlessly extended within the Bayesian framework (the context of radiation damage) to interpolate and complement significantly slower (several orders of magnitude) molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. This involves building a comprehensive database of reference simulations, applying advanced statistical analysis and methods of unsupervised learning to identify an optimal representation.
- Results supported by positive reception at international conferences, invited talks for renowned research groups, publications in reputable journals and commitments from other groups to continue my research
- Extensive experience in developing and deploying for high performance computing (HPC) clusters using modern resource managers and version control systems -- necessary to achieve the above results.
- Involvement in shaping of long-term research strategies, co-administration of large inter-institutional projects, active engagement in knowledge-transfers and mentorship.
