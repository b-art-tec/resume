<span style="color:lightgray">Manchester, United Kingdom</span>\
*Research Associate* (post-doc)
- Introduction of novel approaches to the development of parametric (semi-empirical tight-binding) and machine learning (ML) atomistic models, in particular, integrating classical concepts of optimal design with modern data-driven (atomistic) methods to improve the accuracy and transferability/robustness of ML models.
- Innovative generative surrogate models designed to be seamlessly extended within the Bayesian framework (the context of radiation damage) to interpolate and complement significantly slower (several orders of magnitude) molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. This involves building a comprehensive database of reference simulations, applying advanced statistical analysis and methods of unsupervised learning to identify an optimal representation.
- Results supported by positive reception at international conferences, invited talks for renowned research groups, publications in reputable journals and commitments from other groups to continue my research
- Extensive experience in developing and deploying for high performance computing (HPC) clusters using modern resource managers and version control systems -- necessary to achieve the above results.
- Involvement in shaping of long-term research strategies, co-administration of large inter-institutional projects, active engagement in knowledge-transfers and mentorship.

<div style="float: right"> March 2013 - December 2013 </div> \
<span style="color:lightgray">London, United Kingdom</span>\
*Visiting Researcher* (same level as post-doc)
- Collaboration with NPLs Data Science team on EU funded grant - Traceability for Computationally Intensive Metrology.
- Successful development of numerical artefacts using computer algebra systems (CAS) and automated symbolic integration for the evaluation and validation of measurement software. Use cases related to propagation of distributions and uncertainty quantification.
- Results included in the project deliverables and published in a recognised in the field journal.

*Metrolog* (specialist)
- Metrologist at Polish national metrology institute (NMI).
- Management and development of calibration procedures (high-precision measurements), including maintenance of documentation and training of technicians, while adhering to the quality management system (ISO 17025 and ISO 9001).
- Using state-of-the-art statistical analysis and a deep physical understanding of the phenomena involved to improve traceability and methodologies in metrology. Results were presented during international meetings, conferences and published as scientific articles.
- Advising government institutions and legislators.
